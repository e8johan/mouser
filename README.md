# Mouser

## Introduction

Mouser is a silly mouse duplication program.

## Usage

If you run ``mouser`` you will get one more mouse pointer with a random offset of the actual pointer.

If you run ``mouser 10`` you will get ten additional pointers.

If you want to add more chaos I recomment that you run multiple instances of mouser instead of using the command line argument. This means that each pointer is a process of its own.
